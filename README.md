Description:
-------------
This project takes you through the process of mashing up data from two different APIs to create movie recommendations. The project combines the power of the TasteDive API and the OMDB API to provide you with movie recommendations based on your preferences and detailed movie information, including scores from various review sites.

TasteDive API:
--------------
The TasteDive API allows you to provide a movie, band, TV show, or other related items as a query input. It then returns a set of related items, helping you discover similar movies or entertainment options that align with your interests.

OMDB API:
---------
The OMDB API lets you provide a movie title as a query input and retrieves comprehensive data about the movie, including:

- Title
- Release Year
- Plot Summary
- Director
- Actors
- Ratings from various review sites (e.g., Rotten Tomatoes, IMDB)
- Genre
- Runtime
- and more.

Usage:
------
1. Start by inputting a movie, band, or TV show title to the TasteDive API to discover related items.

2. Select a movie from the list of recommendations that you'd like to know more about.

3. Retrieve detailed information about the selected movie using the OMDB API, including ratings and other essential data.

4. Make informed decisions about which movies to watch based on your preferences and the available information.

Dependencies:
-------------
- Python 3.x
- Requests library (for making API calls)
- API keys for both TasteDive and OMDB APIs (update API keys in the code as necessary)
